    <section id="approach">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>Our method is simple: disciplined questions, authoritative sources, and elegant presentation. The House of Barton Wilson is an independent practice. We value the pursuit of getting the facts straight as well as acknowledging and appreciating ambiguity. We believe that storytelling lies at the heart of good history. AI can never replace the human voice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discovery</strong> — understand goals, stakeholders, timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Design</strong> — scope the archive, build a research plan, propose structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong> — execute research, draft prose, and iterate with editorial reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery</strong> — final manuscript or dossier, with citations and production‑ready files.</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>America's Cold Warrior — James Graham Wilson</h3>
          <p>In America's Cold Warrior, James Graham Wilson traces Paul Nitze's career path in national security after World War II, a time when many of his mentors and peers returned to civilian life. Serving in eight presidential administrations, Nitze commanded White House attention even when he was out of government, especially with his withering criticism of Jimmy Carter during Carter's presidency. While Nitze is perhaps best known for leading the formulation of NSC-68, which Harry Truman signed in 1950, Wilson contends that Nitze's most significant contribution to American peace and security came in the painstaking work done in the 1980s to negotiate successful treaties with the Soviets to reduce nuclear weapons while simultaneously deflecting skeptics surrounding Ronald Reagan. America's Cold Warrior connects Nitze's career and concerns about strategic vulnerability to the post-9/11 era and the challenges of the 2020s, where the United States finds itself locked in geopolitical competition with the People's Republic of China and Russia.</p>
